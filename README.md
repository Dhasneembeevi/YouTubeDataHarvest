# YouTubeDataHarvest
This project builds a Streamlit app to collect and analyze YouTube channel data. It integrates with the YouTube API to fetch channel and video details, stores data in MySQL or PostgreSQL, and offers an interactive interface for querying and visualizing results, including statistics, metrics, and comments.
